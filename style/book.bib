  abstract = {Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoaWilld.) and ka{\~n}iwa (Chenopodium pallidicauleAellen) are native food plants of high nutritional value grown in the Andean region and used as food by the Incas and previous cultures. Quinoa and ka{\~n}iwa served as a substitute for scarce animal proteins and are still one of the principal protein sources of the region. The importance of these proteins is based on their quality, with a balanced composition of essential amino acids similar to the composition of casein, the protein of milk. According to studies at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina (UNALM), quinoa and ka{\~n}iwa have a very high chemical score, and one cultivar of quinoa, Amarilla de Marangani, does not have any limiting amino acid. It is also important to recognize and utilize the relatively high quantity of oil in quinoa and ka{\~n}iwa. These grains can be a potential raw material for oil extraction. The highest percentage of fatty acids present in these oils is Omega 6 (linoleic acid), being 50.2\% for quinoa and 42.6\% for ka{\~n}iwa. The fatty acid composition is similar to corn germ oil. The concentrations of {$\gamma$}- and {$\alpha$}-tocoferol were for quinoa 797.2 and 721.4 ppm, and for ka{\~n}iwa 788.4 and 726 ppm, respectively. Quinoa and ka{\~n}iwa can been utilized in weaning food mixtures. Two dietary mixtures have been formulated: quinoa-ka{\~n}iwa-beans and quinoa-kiwicha-beans, with high nutritional value. The mixtures had PER values close to that of casein: 2.36 and 2.59, respectively (casein 2.5). Also, elderly people and those with a need to lose weight can benefit from consumption of quinoa and ka{\~n}iwa. The high content of dietary fiber has many positive health effects, for example, it can reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood and improve digestion. For this reason, consumers in developed countries may also have an interest in including quinoa into their diet.},

  abstract = {This study reports on the search for naturally occurring bacteria which are able to promote the growth and survival of Argopecten purpuratus larvae by inhibiting the activity of other deleterious bacteria that flourish in hatchery cultures. A total of 506 bacterial isolates, obtained from laboratory and hatchery sources, were evaluated for the production of substances inhibitory to a Vibrio anguillarum-related (VAR) larval pathogen, of which 11 (2.2\%) were found positive. One of these strains (Vibrio sp.), when used as a pre-treatment, protected the scallop larvae against subsequent experimental infection with the VAR pathogen.},

  title = {Physiological Responses of the {{Chilean}} Scallop {{Argopecten}} Purpuratus to Decreasing Salinities},
  volume = {167},
  issn = {0044-8486},
  abstract = {Argopecten purpuratus (Chilean scallop) is a filter-feeding bivalve which inhabits sheltered areas of the north and central Chile. Considering that culture of this species has started in the south of Chile, it is of great interest to know the tolerance of this bivalve to conditions of decreasing salinity, which can occur in these locations. For this purpose, different physiological processes related to the acquisition and utilisation of energy (clearance rate, absorption, oxygen uptake and excretion) were measured at different salinities (30, 27, 24, 21 and 18\textperthousand{}) on a wide range of body size after the scallops had been acclimatised to the experimental salinities for a week at 12\textdegree{}C. Clearance rate showed higher and similar values at 30 and 27\textperthousand, decreasing significantly at the lower salinities. Oxygen uptake increased with decreasing salinity from 30 to 24\textperthousand, showing the lowest value at the extreme condition of 18\textperthousand. A similar pattern was presented by the excretion rate, which also increased within the range 30-24\textperthousand, to show a reduction with decreasing salinities. The O/N ratio also decreased with reduction in salinity in the 5 and 10 g size classes. A negative relationship was observed between the size of A. purpuratus and the O/N ratio. Scope for growth was highly affected by low salinities, with positive values only between 27 and 30\textperthousand. Negative scope for growth was observed at all the other experimental salinities. The data obtained suggest that the selection of sites to cultivate this species must take into consideration the tolerance of this species to the salinity, and positive growth rates can be expected at salinities over 27\textperthousand.},
